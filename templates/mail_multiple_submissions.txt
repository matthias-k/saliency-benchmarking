I want to make you aware that in order to avoid overfitting to the benchmark dataset, we don't let researchers evaluate too many models within a short time. I'm happy to evaluate both models that you submitted, but then I would need to ask you to wait a few months with further submissions. Please let me know whether I should evaluate both models.
